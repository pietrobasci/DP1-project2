# A simple Dynamic Website for flight tickets booking

Final (2-weeks) project for the course "Programmazione Distribuita I" @Politecnico di Torino.

Main aspects addressed: concurrency, security protections (against injections, DB passwords attacks), sessions, asynchronous web page update to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page (Ajax).
